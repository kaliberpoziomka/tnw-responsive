This project showed me how powerful responsive design is.
I understood how to make layaout and build visual hierarchy with media queries depending on screen size.

The biggest suprise to me was how easy changing the horizontal to vertical layout is. 
It actually shocked me, when I made desptop layout and then just changed it with few lines of code to mobile version
